Final Project for IT101-1: Computer Programming Concepts 1 (Lab).

The project "Ocean Cleanup Challenge" is a simple and fun game where the user acts as a submarine collecting trash underwater, evading barrels of toxic waste and avoiding the coral borders. It is inspired from games like "ResponSEAble" (2018), Seavax Ocean Cleanup, and the classic snake game.

Every time the user collects trash, they will receive a point, and when they collide with toxic waste or the coral borders, they lose a life out of their 3 lives.

INSTRUCTIONS: Press "P" to Play, Press "I" to View Instructions, Press "H" to View Highscores, and Press "L" to Leave the game.

HOW TO PLAY: Your submarine will automatically move forwardm but you can control its direction using WASD keys. W to move up, A to move left, S to move down, and D to move right.

OBJECTIVE: Navigate your submarine through the ocean, collecting as much trash as possible while avoiding obstacles. The more trash you collect, the higher your scores will be.
